# GA_TSP

A first attempt at a genetic algorithm to solve the travelling salesman problem, in python 3.

Currently a bit slow (for a 50 city trek, one generation breeding/mutating/evaluation/plotting takes about a second).

Todos: speed up process, tune mutation rates, implement better selection method (currently using elitism).
